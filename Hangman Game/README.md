# Hangman Game

## Description
A simple text-based Hangman game in Python where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.  
The game selects a random word from a small predefined list, and the player has 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends. 
This project was developed using **PyCharm IDE** for ease of coding, debugging, and running Python scripts.

## How to Play
1. Open the project in PyCharm or any Python IDE.
2. Run the Python script `hangman.py`.

## Key Concepts Used
- **`random`** → Selects a random word from a list.  
- **`while` loop** → Keeps the game running until the player wins or loses.  
- **`if-elif-else`** → Checks whether the guessed letter is correct, incorrect, or already guessed.  
- **Strings & Lists** → Stores the secret word, guessed letters, and displays progress to the player.  
- **Functions (optional)** → Can be used to organize code (e.g., display word, check guess).  
- **Input/Output** → Interacts with the player through the console.
