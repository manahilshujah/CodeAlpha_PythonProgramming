# Task Title: Basic Chatbot

## Description
This is a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python.  
It can respond to basic user inputs such as greetings, asking about its status, and saying goodbye.  

The chatbot demonstrates **fundamental programming concepts** like loops, conditional statements, functions, and input/output handling in Python.  

The project was developed using **PyCharm IDE** for easier coding and testing.

---

## Features
- Responds to common greetings like "hello" and "hi"
- Can answer questions like "how are you"
- Ends conversation when the user types "bye"
- Provides a default response for unrecognized inputs
- Simple, beginner-friendly, and console-based

---

## How to Use
1. Open the project in **PyCharm** or any Python IDE.
2. Run the Python script `chatbot.py`.
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing messages in the console.
4. Example conversation:

## Key Concepts Used
- **Functions** → Encapsulate the chatbot logic in a reusable `chatbot()` function.  
- **While Loop (`while True`)** → Keeps the conversation running until the user types "bye".  
- **Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)** → Determine the appropriate response based on user input.  
- **Input/Output (`input()` and `print()`)** → Interact with the user via the console.  
- **String Methods (`.lower()`)** → Make user input case-insensitive for accurate responses.
